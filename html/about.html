<h1>Weekly Chore Tracker</h1>
<p>
Keeping track of chores is... well... a chore.
This progressive web app chore tracker makes it easy to track chores that recur weekly.
The minimal interface aims to minimize distractions and stay out of your way.
Once your chores are done, confetti will fall to let you know you've done a great job.
</p>

<h3>Data Storage</h3>
<p>
While more advanced chore trackers support syncing across multiple devices, this chore tracker stores your chore list only in your browser.
</p>

<h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
<p>
Staying on top of chores is hard.
We tried several other trackers, but so many tried to be too full featured and ended up being less efficient than a paper tracker.
Some trackers would reset task lists at midnight, but as a procrastinator I'd often finish some chores after midnight.
Nothing quite matched what we needed.
</p>

<h3>Can you add...?</h3>
<p>
My plan is to keep this tool fairly minimal.
If you are a programmer, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ralexander-phi/chore-wheel">fork the code</a> and extend.
Otherwise, <a href="https://github.com/ralexander-phi/chore-wheel/issues/new">file an issue</a> and I'll see if I can fit it in.
</p>

<p>
I am open to design and style suggestions that keep things minimal.
File an issue if you want to lend a hand.
</p>

<h3>Tracking usage</h3>
<p>
I don't use analytics on any of my pages, your ad and tracker blockers should never find things to block here.
However, this means I can't easily gauge usage.
If you use this tool and like it, I'd appreciate a <a href="https://github.com/ralexander-phi/chore-wheel">star on the GitHub project page</a> to let me know.
</p>

<h3>A paper tracker?</h3>
<p>
When tech fails, go old school.
Paper tools are often quite flexible and are infinitely customizable.
We used to use a grid (like the one below) for chores.
You can draw the grid on paper or a whiteboard and use pins or magnets (respectively) to track chore status.
As chores are completed, the pins should cycle through the week.
</p>

<p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Chore</th>
    <th>Monday</th>
    <th>Tuesday</th>
    <th>Wednesday</th>
    <th>Thursday</th>
    <th>Friday</th>
    <th>Saturday</th>
    <th>Sunday</th>
  </tr>

<p>
Moving from paper to an app, I settled on a slightly different design.
This app works for me, so I'm finally ditching the paper.
